                <summary>My Background</summary>
                <p>I grew up in Central California. I love to analyze the financial markets and make music. I used to be a Hip-Hop/R&B music producer but fell more into computer science soon after. I've been coding for about 1 year now non-stop but overall it's been in my life since 2008. I want to potentially grow these skills into a career of my own one day.</p>
